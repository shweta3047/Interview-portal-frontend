# Interview-Scheduler

Created a simple app where admins can create interviews by selecting participants, interview start time and end time

## Features
- An interview creation page where the admin can create an interview by selecting participants, start time and end time. Backend should throw error with proper error message if: 
  - Any of the participants is not available during the scheduled time (i.e, has another interview scheduled)
  - No of participants is less than 2
- An interviews list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.
- An interview edit page where admin can edit the created interview with the same validations as on the creation page.
- Send emails to participants on interview creation.
- Created app’s frontend as a SPA
